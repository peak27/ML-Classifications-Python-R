# Classifications (w/ Python & R)
This repository consists of various classification techniques such as Logistic regression, Decision Tree, K Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Random Forest Classification, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel-SVM.

# **Project name:** # Classifications (w/ Python & R)

## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification in machine learning is a predictive modeling preoblem where a class lable is predicted for a given example of given data. For e.g. classify if e-mail is spam or ham, to predict if the person is diabetic and more.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this repository, we are focusing on building complex statistical Classification models to predict and visualize the prediction results on categorical dependent variables. Based on the nature of problem and dataset, we can determine the right classification techniques for better accuracy.


## Installation 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to be able to apply these regression techniques to predict outcome on your dataset you need to have following tools and libraries:
  * Python 2.x or Python 3.x
  * Pandas
  * NumPy
  * Scikit-Learn
  * R (For R implementation)

## Usage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification methods are very common term and technique in the field of data science. You can use these classification methods to predict the categorical dependent variables such as status of email (ham or spam), result of student in exam (Pass or Fail), etc.

## Contributing
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can implement these different models on the same dataset to determine the most accurate model.

## Credits 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an individual project.
